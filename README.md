## Getting metrics for the mean Spanish plant collector

### Building a list of observers

The goal is the create metrics for a list of 'mean' observers. We created a gbif export for research grade inaturalist observations, in spain, since 2016. Then filtered on observers with atleast 100 observations since then. 

The export is here: GBIF.org (09 November 2021) GBIF Occurrence Download https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.svwnrp 

This results in 461 observers meeting this criteria. 

### Getting all inat observations for these users
